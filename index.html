<p>{% include image.html url="/images/headshot1.jpg" width=300 height=350 align="right" %}Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>I am a postdoctoral associate at the <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">Center for the Study of Democratic Politics</a> at Princeton University. In September 2025, I will join the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government">Government Department at the London School of Economics and Political Science</a> as an Assistant Professor. I received my PhD from the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html">Wilf Family Department of Politics</a> at New York University, where I was a graduate affiliate with the <a href="https://publicsafetylab.org/">NYU Public Safety Lab</a> and a fellow with the <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/academics/scholarly-strengths/urban-initiative/enroll-learn/urban-doctoral-fellowship-program/meet-the-fellows.html">Urban Initiative at NYU's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service</a>.<br><br>

My research interests lie in American Politics, Political Methodology, and Political Economy. I examine the interactions between politicians, bureaucrats, and voters. In particular, I study incentives and selection in local bureaucracies and their implications for public policy and accountability. To provide rigorous empirical evidence on these issues, I employ quasi-experimental and cutting-edge data science tools to leverage a combination of novel administrative datasets, spatial data, and political text. <br><br>

I also hold an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a BA in Political Science and Economics from University of Mannheim. Before graduate school at NYU, I worked as a researcher in the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Chair of Econometrics at University of Mannheim and the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research.</p>
