		<b>Sorting for K-Street: Post-Employment Regulations and Wage Setting in Congress</b><br>
		<i>Conditionally Accepted at Journal of Politics</i><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> While post-employment regulations are a common tool to slow the revolving door in government, little is known about their effectiveness and consequences. Using the 2007 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA), I argue that policymakers strategically adjust their behaviors to maintain lucrative career options in the lobbying industry. HLOGA prohibited staffers-turned-lobbyists who earn at least 75% of a Congress member's salary from contacting their ex-employers in Congress for one year. Using data on the complete set of congressional staff (2001-2016), I show that staffers sort below the salary threshold post-HLOGA. Employing various panel data analyses, I also find that selecting out of the regulation increases a staffer's probability to become a lobbyist and ensures a substantial premium in revenues at the beginning of their lobbying career. These results explain why reforms of the revolving door fail and provide insights on institutional determinants of career incentives for non-elected public officials.   <br>

		<b>Political Power of Bureaucratic Agents: Evidence from Policing in New York City</b><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> To what extent can bureaucrats manipulate public service provision for explicitly political ends? A growing body of work highlights the immense ability of bureaucrats to influence governments through campaign contributions, endorsements, collective bargaining, and organized election turnout. I explore a more fundamental mechanism of bureaucratic influence: bureaucrats strategically shirking responsibilities. Politicians depend on bureaucrats to achieve policy goals. This gives the latter leverage over the former. If bureaucrats deviate in their preferences from politicians and are organized in cohesive unions with strong tenure protections, they can collectively reduce effort to exert political pressure. I use data on New York Police Department (NYPD) 911 response times together with council members' preferences on the FY2021 $1 billion cut to the NYPD's budget. Employing difference-in-differences and spatial difference-in-discontinuities designs, I find that police reduced effort in districts of non-aligned politicians by slowing response times. This study informs the theoretical debate on principal-agent relationships in government and highlights the importance of organized political interests to explain policing in US cities.  <br>

		<b>Multilanguage Word Embeddings for Social Scientists: Estimation, Inference and Validation Resources for 157 Languages</b><br>
		<i>with Pedro L. Rodriguez, Arthur Spirling, and Brandon M. Stewart</i><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> Word embeddings are now a vital resource for social science research. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to obtain high quality embeddings for non-English languages, and it may be computational expensive to do so.  In addition, social scientists typically want to make statistical comparisons and do hypothesis tests on embeddings, but this is non-trivial with current approaches. We provide three new data resources designed to ameliorate the union of these issues: (1) a new version of <tt>fastText</tt> model embeddings, fit to Wikipedia corpora; (2) a multi-language "a la carte" (ALC) embedding version of the <tt>fastText</tt> model fit to Wikipedia corpora; (3) a multi-language ALC embedding version of the well-known <tt>GloVe</tt> model fit to Wikipedia corpora. These materials are aimed at "low resource" users who lack access to large corpora in their language of interest, or  who lack access to the computational resources required to produce high-quality vector representations. We make these resources available for 30 languages, along with a code pipeline for another 127 languages available from Wikipedia corpora.  We provide extensive validation of the materials, via reconstruction tests and some translation proofs-of-concept.  We also conduct and report on human crowdworker tests, for our embeddings for Arabic, French, (traditional, Mandarin) Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian and  Spanish.<br>

		<b>Politicized Meritocracy: Determinants of Partisan and Racial Selection in US City Governments</b><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> A rich body of research emphasizes the importance of a representative government for policymaking and public service provision. Yet, recent work on the composition of US bureaucracies reveals significant gaps in the descriptive representation of partisan and racial groups in government and their consequences for service delivery. What drives partisan and racial selection in professionalized bureaucracies? Focusing on selection in New York City's government, this project addresses the question in three steps. First, I use detailed administrative data on the characteristics of city employees, including their partisanship, race, and gender, to illustrate the representational gaps between local bureaucrats and their constituents. Second, I focus on the New York Police Department (NYPD) and unpack the dynamics of partisan and racial misrepresentation. I find that Republican and white employees are more likely to be hired, promoted, appointed to senior ranks, receive more departmental awards, and have longer tenure than non-white and Democratic officers. Third, I show that the murder of George Floyd substantially increased turnover at the NYPD and affected the racial and partisan composition of police on the margins. By delineating the complexities of selection in modern bureaucracies, this study provides new evidence about how independent, professional bureaucracies are politicized endogenously.  <br>

		<b>A Formal Model of Bureaucratic Sabotage</b><br>
		<i>with Kun Heo</i><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> How does bureaucrats' discretion in public service provision affect policy-making? While anecdotal evidence suggests that reform endeavors often falter due to a unique resistance from local government employees, the underlying dynamics and determinants of bureaucratic resistance remain unexplored. We provide a formal model of bureaucratic resistance to show when and how electoral incentives vest bureaucrats with political power, trigger sabotage of public services, and affect politicians' reform policies. We study a two-period costly signaling game with information constraints between an incumbent, a challenger, a bureaucrat, and a voter. The incumbent seeks re-election by deciding between a reform policy of uncertain value and the status quo and is confronted by an anti-reform bureaucrat. Since the voter does not observe politicians' performance directly and needs to rely on bureaucrats' effort to inform her vote choice, bureaucrats can use costly shirking to damage politicians' reputation. We find that in equilibrium, with positive probability, incumbents implement reform and bureaucrats sabotage the policy's reputation. The possibility of sabotage leads to policy inefficiency, whose type depends on the status quoâ€™s value. If the value of the status quo is high, in equilibrium, sabotage induces underinvestment in reform compared to the optimal level (strategic substitutes). For low values of the status quo, sabotage leads to overinvestment in reform due to pandering (strategic complements). <br>

		<b>Fiscal Crisis and Gender Pay Gap in the Bureaucracy</b><br>
		<i>with Hye Young You and Kyuwon Lee</i><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> How does a fiscal crisis change the gender pay gap in a bureaucracy? To answer this question, we exploit the sudden budget crisis in Massachusetts (MA) in 2015 and examine how methods that governments employ to downsize their agencies - increasing senior officials' discretion in setting compensation and adopting individualized negotiations - have unequal impacts on government employees. Using 1.4 million observations of detailed individual-level data about public employees in the MA state government for the period 2010-2020, we find that the fiscal crisis increased the gender pay gap in executive agencies by 2.4 percentage points. Consequently, women earned significantly less than their comparable male counter-parts after the fiscal crisis. We also find that there is significant variation in the gender pay gap: women in more senior positions and women who work in agencies with smaller shares of female employees (public safety and transportation) experienced the largest gender pay gap. <br>
