<p>{% include image.html url="/images/headshot_new.jpg" width=400 height=450 align="right" %}Hello, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>

I am an Assistant Professor for Public Policy and Political Science in the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government">Government Department at the London School of Economics and Political Science</a>. Before joining LSE, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">Center for the Study of Democratic Politics</a> at Princeton University.<br><br>

I received my PhD from the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html">Wilf Family Department of Politics</a> at New York University in 2024. My dissertation received the Dean's Outstanding Dissertation Award at NYU, the <a href="https://www.sioe.org/sioe-awards">Ronald H. Coase Best Dissertation Award</a> from the Society for Institutional & Organizational Economics, and the <a href="https://apsanet.org/membership/organized-sections/organized-section-awards/past-awards/section-13/#dissertation">Best Dissertation Award</a> from the Urban and Local Politics Section of the American Political Science Association.<br><br>

My research focuses on American political institutions, bureaucratic politics, local government, and political methodology. My current work explores how incentives and selection in bureaucracies affect public policy and accountability. I approach these issues by examining strategic interactions among politicians, bureaucrats, and voters, and their impact on public service provision, regulatory policy, and the representativeness of government. My work leverages a range of research designs and data sources, including causal inference methods for observational data, text analysis, administrative records, spatial data, and game theory. My work is published or forthcoming in the <em>Journal of Politics</em> and <em>Political Analysis</em>.<br><br>

I hold an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a BA in Political Science and Economics from University of Mannheim. Before graduate school at NYU, I worked as a researcher in the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Chair of Econometrics at University of Mannheim and the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research.</p>
