<p>{% include image.html url="/images/headshot1.jpg" width=300 height=350 align="right" %}Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html">Wilf Family Department of Politics</a> at New York University. I am on the job market in Fall 2023. I am a graduate affiliate with the <a href="https://publicsafetylab.org/">NYU Public Safety Lab</a> and the Political Institutions and Political Economy Research (PIPER) Lab. My research interests lie in American Politics, Political Methodology and Political Economy.<br><br>

My research examines the interactions between politicians, bureaucrats and voters from a political economy perspective. In particular, I study incentives and selection in local bureaucracies and their implications for public policy and accountability. To provide rigorous empirical evidence on these issues, I employ quasi-experimental and cutting-edge data science tools to leverage a combination of novel administrative datasets, spatial data, and political text. <br><br>

I hold an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics and a BA in Political Science and Economics from University of Mannheim. Before graduate school at NYU, I worked as a researcher in the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Chair of Econometrics at University of Mannheim and the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research.</p>
