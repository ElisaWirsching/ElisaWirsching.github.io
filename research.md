		<b>Sorting for K-Street: Post-Employment Regulations and Wage Setting in Congress</b><br>
		<i>R&R at Journal of Politics</i><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> While post-employment regulations are a common tool to slow the revolving door in government, little is known about their effectiveness and consequences. Using the 2007 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA), I argue that policymakers strategically adjust their behaviors to maintain lucrative career options in the lobbying industry. HLOGA prohibited staffers-turned-lobbyists who earn at least 75% of a Congress member's salary from contacting their ex-employers in Congress for one year. Using data on the complete set of congressional staff (2001-2016), I show that staffers sort below the salary threshold post-HLOGA. Employing various panel data analyses, I also find that selecting out of the regulation increases a staffer's probability to become a lobbyist and ensures a substantial premium in revenues at the beginning of their lobbying career. These results explain why reforms of the revolving door fail and provide insights on institutional determinants of career incentives for non-elected public officials.   <br>

		<b>Political Power of Bureaucratic Agents: Evidence from Policing in New York City</b><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> Research on public organizations highlights how political control of bureaucracies induces bureaucrats to act as electoral brokers for politicians. In contrast, I study the converse mechanism in professionalized bureaucracies. I argue that politicians' dependence on bureaucratic effort for re-election purposes allows politically insulated bureaucrats to exert political power over their elected principals. If bureaucrats are organized in cohesive unions with strong tenure protections and deviate in their preferences from their principals, they can collectively shirk effort to affect the electoral fortunes of politicians. To test this theory, I use data on New York Police Department (NYPD) 911 response times together with council members' preferences on the FY2021 $1 billion cut to the NYPD's budget. Employing difference-in-differences designs, I find that municipal police reduced effort in districts of non-aligned politicians. This study informs the theoretical debate on principal-agent relationships in government and sheds light on the importance of organized political interests to explain policing in US cities. <br>

		<b>Politicized Meritocracy: Determinants of Partisan and Racial Selection in US City Governments</b><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> A large literature on public bureaucracies identifies meritocratic civil service as paramount to building non-political and high-quality bureaucracies. Yet, recent work on the partisan composition of US federal and local bureaucracies challenges this view.  What drives partisan and racial composition of meritocratic bureaucracies? Focusing on selection in New York City's government, this project addresses the question in three steps. First, I use detailed administrative data on the characteristics of city employees, including their partisanship, race and gender, to illustrate the representational gaps between local bureaucrats and their clients. Second, I focus on the New York Police Department (NYPD) and unpack the dynamics of partisan and racial misrepresentation by tracing the types of individuals selecting in and out of NYPD, their political socialization on the force as well as differential career trajectories of various types of officers. Third, I evaluate how institutional factors drive partisan selection in US law enforcement, including preference misalignment with political principals, financial incentives and bureaucrat-client relationships. By delineating the complexities of partisan selection in modern bureaucracies, this study aims to provide new evidence on the determinants of representativeness and performance of city governments.  <br>

		<b>Multilingual Word Embeddings for Social Scientists: Estimation, Inference and Validation Resources for 157 Languages</b><br>
		<i>with Pedro L. Rodriguez, Arthur Spirling, and Brandon M. Stewart</i><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> We consider the problem of estimating high-quality word embeddings for low-resource users. This is a perennial issue for comparative politics scholars who do not have access to large corpora or pretrained representations in their chosen (typically non-English) language.  In particular, we provide a variant of <i>&agrave; la carte embeddings</i> (ALC) embeddings for researchers who lack large training corpora, or lack computational resources, or both. These methods allow for good representations of even very rare words vital to politics (e.g. identities of minor political actors or the names of arcane procedures). We allow for the straightforward production of these embeddings and their relevant weighting matrices for some 157 languages found in the original <tt>fastText</tt> project.  We also provide embeddings fit to the relevant language Wikipedia corpora.  We validate these embeddings in terms of their accuracy and uncertainty.  Along with the data, free software is provided for these purposes. <br>

		<b>Fiscal Crisis and Gender Pay Gap in the Bureaucracy</b><br>
		<i>with Hye Young You and Kyuwon Lee</i><br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> How does a fiscal crisis change the gender pay gap in a bureaucracy? To answer this ques-
tion, we exploit the sudden budget crisis in Massachusetts (MA) in 2015 and examine how
methods that governments employ to downsize their agencies-increasing senior officials'
discretion in setting compensation and adopting individualized negotiations-have unequal
impacts on government employees. Using 1.4 million observations of detailed individual-
level data about public employees in the MA state government for the period 2010-2020, we
find that the fiscal crisis increased the gender pay gap in executive agencies by 2.4 percentage
points. Consequently, women earned significantly less than their comparable male counter-
parts after the fiscal crisis. We also find that there is significant variation in the gender pay
gap: women in more senior positions and women who work in agencies with smaller shares of
female employees (public safety and transportation) experienced the largest gender pay gap. <br>
