<p>{% include image.html url="/images/headshot1.jpg" width=300 height=350 align="right" %}Hello, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>I am a postdoctoral associate at the <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">Center for the Study of Democratic Politics</a> at Princeton University. In September 2025, I will join the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government">Government Department at the London School of Economics and Political Science</a> as an Assistant Professor. I received my PhD from the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html">Wilf Family Department of Politics</a> at New York University, where I was a graduate affiliate with the <a href="https://publicsafetylab.org/">NYU Public Safety Lab</a> and a fellow with the <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/academics/scholarly-strengths/urban-initiative/enroll-learn/urban-doctoral-fellowship-program/meet-the-fellows.html">Urban Initiative at NYU's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service</a>.<br><br>

My research focuses on American political institutions, bureaucratic politics, local government, and political methodology. My current work explores how incentives and selection in bureaucracies affect public policy and accountability. I approach these issues by examining strategic interactions among politicians, bureaucrats, and voters, and their impact on public service provision, regulatory policy, and the representativeness of government. My work leverages a range of research designs and data sources, including causal inference methods for observational data, text analysis, administrative records, spatial data, and game theory. My work is forthcoming in the <em>Journal of Politics</em> and <em>Political Analysis</em>.<br><br>

I also hold an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a BA in Political Science and Economics from University of Mannheim. Before graduate school at NYU, I worked as a researcher in the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Chair of Econometrics at University of Mannheim and the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research.</p>
